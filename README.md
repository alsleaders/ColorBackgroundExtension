# ReminderExtension

## Making a Chrome extension    

Making a Chrome extension in JS to display a reminder when a new tab is opened.  The reminders will be one of an array of statements (like "Have you stood up recently?", "Do you need a water break?", or "It's time to unclench your jaw").  These reminders will show up every certain number of tabs, and that number will be able to be set by user, but will default to 11 tabs.
