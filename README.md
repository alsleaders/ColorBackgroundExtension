# ColorBackgroundExtension

## Making a Chrome extension

Working off the
[Google Chrome Extension docs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/)

of a tab. Then I randomized the colors available in the array of options of
background colors, because the preset options were kinda bland.
